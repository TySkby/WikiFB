DESCRIPTION

Runs via the command line, so it's especially good for Cron jobs or scheduled tasks.

As it stands, this is a PHP utility (good for cron jobs) that scrapes a remote web page, parses out links in a defined content area,
validates the links that work, and saves those to a local file.  The file is then posted to Facebook via the FBCMD application.

This was originally made to automatically get a list WikiLeaks mirrors, pick three of those mirror URLs after validating that they work,
and then post the links to Facebook.  It was an effort to use Facebook as a means of providing active mirrors via status updates.

However, with some tweaking to both files, WikiFB can be an excellent utility to scrape any remote URL content, parse out what
you are looking for, and then save that parsed content somewhere.  And you don't need FBCMD installed to do that.

CONFIGURATION

For basic usage with FBCMD:
-Edit the 'index.php' as per the instructions in the comments.

To use as a general utility:
-Edit 'index.php' and remove/comment out the FBCMD stuff.
-In 'functions.php', edit the function linkCatchVal() to suit your needs.  Currently it is set up to validate links from "<a href...>" HTML tags,
but some simple changes can make it do other stuff.
-Remove/comment out fbCustom() and fbUpdate() functions in 'functions.php'.
